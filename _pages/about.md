Hello, I’m Saba Sahban, a 23-year-old computer engineering graduate from Tehran, Iran. I recently completed my bachelor's degree at <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/" target="_blank"><strong>Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)</strong></a>, and I am planning to pursue a graduate degree.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities! 🤝
